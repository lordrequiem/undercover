# Tech stack

- `backend/`: FastAPI and SQLite. Every API operation has an `operation_id`, a one-line docstring and no optional inputs. Paying a claim is a separate operation that takes the amount.
- `agent/`: LangChain's `create_agent` on OpenRouter. `run_queue(limit)` works the whole queue with a fresh per-claim helper; `work_claim(claim_id)` works one named claim. It reaches claims, its instructions and the handbook (the policy wording and the claims manual, looked up section by section) only through the backend's API. It uses `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` with low reasoning effort by default, or the model in the environment variable `MODEL_NAME` if set, such as `openrouter/free`.
- `dashboard/`: React, Vite and TypeScript.
- `e2e/`: Playwright tests.
- `data/`: the business data the backend starts from. The agent never sees `data/evals/`, which holds the answer key.

Python 3.12 with uv, all in the root `pyproject.toml`. Node 26. The OpenRouter key is `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env`.
